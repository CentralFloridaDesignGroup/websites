                        <p>Members of the American Land Title Association® (ALTA) have specific needs, unique to title insurance matters, when asked to insure title to land without exception as to the many matters which might be discoverable from survey and inspection, and which are not evidenced by the public records.</p>
                        <p>For a survey of real property, and the plat, map or record of such survey, to be acceptable to a title insurance company for the purpose of insuring title to said real property free and clear of survey matters (except those matters disclosed by the survey and indicated on the plat or map), certain specific and pertinent information must be presented for the distinct and clear understanding between the insured, the client (if different from the insured), the title insurance company (insurer), the lender, and the surveyor professionally responsible for the survey.</p>
                        <p>In order to meet such needs, clients, insurers, insureds, and lenders are entitled to rely on surveyors to conduct surveys and prepare associated plats or maps that are of a professional quality and appropriately uniform, complete, and accurate. To that end, and in the interests of the general public, the surveying profession, title insurers, and abstracters, the ALTA and the NSPS jointly promulgate the within details and criteria setting forth a minimum standard of performance for ALTA/NSPS Land Title Surveys. A complete ALTA/NSPS Land Title Survey includes: </p>

It is an agreed-to framework that all parties involved in a commerical land transaction (often worth hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars). In some jurisdictions, the requirements of the ALTA standards are more strict than typical boundary surveys. By adhering to these standards, surveyors help ensure that the surveys they produce are reliable and meet the expectations of title insurers, lenders, and other stakeholders. This reduces the risk of disputes and claims related to property boundaries and easements.</p>

In addition to the standards set forth herein, surveyors must also conduct their surveys in accordance with applicable jurisdictional survey requirements and standards of practice. Where conflicts between the standards set forth herein and any such jurisdictional requirements and standards of practice occur, the more stringent must apply.

                                <b>Boundary</b> The boundary lines and corners of any property or interest in real property being surveyed (hereafter, the “surveyed property” or “property to be surveyed”) as part of an ALTA/NSPS Land Title Survey must be established and/or retraced in accordance with appropriate boundary law principles governed by the set of facts and evidence found in the course of performing the research and fieldwork.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Measurement Standards</b> The following measurement standards address Relative Positional Precision for the monuments or witnesses marking the corners of the surveyed property.
                                <ol className='list-[lower-roman] list-inside space-y-1 ps-4 -indent-4'>
                                    <li>"Relative Positional Precision" is the accepted indicator of measurement quality on an ALTA/NSPS Land Title Survey. It is defined as the length of the semi-major axis, expressed in meters or feet, of the error ellipse of the line connecting the monuments or witnesses marking adjacent boundary corners of the surveyed property at the 95 percent confidence level. Relative Positional Precision is most commonly estimated by the results of a correctly weighted least squares adjustment of the survey, or alternatively it can be estimated by the standard deviation of the distance between the monument or witness marking any boundary corner of the surveyed property and the monument or witness marking an immediately adjacent boundary corner of the surveyed property (called local accuracy) that can be computed using the full covariance matrix of the coordinate inverse between any given pair of points, understanding that Relative Positional Precision is based on the 95 percent confidence level.</li>
                                    <li>Any boundary lines and corners established or retraced may have uncertainties in location resulting from (1) the availability, condition, history and integrity of reference or controlling monuments, (2) ambiguities in the record descriptions or plats of the surveyed property or its adjoining properties, (3) occupation or possession lines as they may differ from the written title lines, or (4) Relative Positional Precision. Of these four sources of uncertainty, only Relative Positional Precision is controllable, although, due to the inherent errors in any measurement, it cannot be eliminated. The magnitude of the first three uncertainties can be projected based on evidence; Relative Positional Precision is estimated using statistical means (see Section 3.E.i. above and Section 3.E.v. below). </li>
                                    <li> The first three of these sources of uncertainty must be weighed as part of the evidence in the determination of where, in the surveyor's opinion, the boundary lines and corners of the surveyed property should be located (see Section 3.D. above). Relative Positional Precision is a measure of how precisely the surveyor is able to monument and report those positions; it is not a substitute for the application of proper boundary law principles. A boundary corner or line may have a small Relative Positional Precision because the survey measurements were precise, yet still be in the wrong position (i.e., inaccurate) if it was established or retraced using faulty or improper application of boundary law principles. </li>
                                    <li>For any measurement technology or procedure used on an ALTA/NSPS Land Title Survey, the surveyor must (1) use appropriately trained personnel, (2) compensate for systematic errors, including those associated with instrument calibration, and (3) use appropriate error propagation and measurement design theory (selecting the proper instruments, geometric layouts, and field and computational procedures) to control random errors such that the; maximum allowable Relative Positional Precision outlined in Section 3.E.v. below is not exceeded. </li>
                                    <li> The maximum allowable Relative Positional Precision for an ALTA/NSPS Land Title Survey is 2 cm (0.07 feet) plus 50 parts per million (based on the direct distance between the two corners being tested). It is recognized that in certain circumstances, the size or configuration of the surveyed property, or the relief, vegetation, or improvements on the surveyed property, will result in survey measurements for which the maximum allowable Relative Positional Precision may be exceeded in which case the reason shall be noted pursuant to Section 6.B.x. below. </li>

                            <li><b>Effective Date:</b> The 2026 standards are effective February 23, 2026, superseding all previous versions.</li>
                            <li><b>Compliance with Local Laws:</b> Surveyors must adhere to local, state, and regional surveying standards, applying the more stringent requirements in case of conflicts. i.e. these requirements are suplimentary, not a replacement for local laws.</li>
                            <li><b>Standard of Care:</b> Surveyors should be aware of unwritten local standards defined by the practice of the “prudent surveyor.”</li>
                            <li><b>Boundary retracement accuracy:</b> Surveyors must ensure accurate retracement of boundaries in accordance with established standards and practices. Using the 95% confidence level test (also known as the RMS value) is the accepted form of testing to use boundary corners. The minimum accuracy is <b>2cm (0.07') + 50 parts per million.</b>
                                <p className='ps-6'>For example, two points that are 200.00 feet apart get tested by:</p>
                                <p className='ps-12 italic text-gray-700'>0.07' + (50 ppm [0.00005] x 200.00 feet) = 0.07 feet + 0.01 feet = <b>0.08</b> feet</p>
                                <p className='ps-6'>This means the maximum allowable error between these two points is 0.08 feet.</p>

                                Out of the four (4) sources of uncertainty listed (boundary monument condition, record descriptions, occupation lines, and Relative Positional Precision), only Relative Positional Precision is controllable by the surveyor. The other three must be evaluated as part of the evidence in determining boundary locations in accordance with current boundary law principles. However, relative positional accuracy cannot be fully eliminated due to inherent measurement errors.
                            </li>
                            <li>There are obvious situations where the accuracy of measured boundary corners cannot meet the minimum standards due to external factors. In these situations, follow the requirements of reporting under <b>Section 6.B.x</b>.</li>

                        <p>Records research and receiving title is the ultimate difference between a typical boundary survey and an ALTA / NSPS Land Title survey. It is essential for ensuring the survey accurately reflects all interests and encumbrances on the property. While previous versions of these standards stated that providing the records is solely the insurer's responsibility, the current standards emphasize collaboration between the insurer and the surveyor to ensure all necessary information is obtained. Specifically, the Surveyor must perform records research to the level required to "... be located and shown upon the map"<sup>1</sup> pursuant to 5J-17.052(4)(b), Florida Administrative Code.</p>
                        <p>1: 5J-17.052(4)(d), Florida Administrative Code historically has been interpreted as the Surveyor need not to pull the records. This update does add the language that the Surveyor does have a duty to pull the publically available records.</p>
